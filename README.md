# MassiveEFT-Operators

A Mathematica package to identify bases of kinematically independent contact terms in four dimensions. This classification is equivalent to the classification of marginal operators for any Effective Field Theory. This is the implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02681.
